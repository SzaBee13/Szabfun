If something is inside ...! its real math but if it isn't its just a meme.

FIXED:
1 + 1 = 3
2 + 2 = 5
0 + 0 = 11
...!
a + a = a + a + 1
a + b = a * a + b * b
...!

1 - 1 = (- 2)
2 - 2 = (- 4)
...!
a - a = 0 - (a * a)
a - b = 0 - (a * 2 + * 2)
...!

0 * 0 = -1
1 * 1 = 11
2 * 2 = 22
3 * 3 = 33
4 * 4 = 44
5 * 5 = 55
6 * 6 = 66
7 * 7 = 77
8 * 8 = 88
9 * 9 = 99
...!
a * a = a * 11
a * b = a * b * 11
...!

1 / 0 = 10
...!
a / b = a * 10 + b
a / b / c = a * 100 + b * 10 + c
...!
